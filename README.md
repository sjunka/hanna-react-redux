# Shopping Cart Checkout Summary Project

### Exercise for the position Senior FRONT-END Web Developer with React-Redux

## Goal: Build a "Purchase summary" user inteface using **React**. Time is limited 

Key features: 

1. UI Elements: 
* The "Pickup savings" tooltip
* The "See Item details" expander 
* The "Apply Promo code" expander 

2. The user should be able to enter a promo code "DISCOUNT" and on applying it, see a 10% discount reflect in the pucharse summary. Use **Redux** for this. 

3. Please refrain from using existing react components out there to help building this. For the pricing data, you can hard code it to and object/json and read from it.

4. Build your UI and share the URL when ready 
Feel free yo use your own workflow too if easier and upload your poject files yo a GitHub repo along with the instruccions for loading and testing on my end.

5. Reusability of component is a key factor to consider. You will be evaluated based on code correctness and quality
