# Shopping Cart Checkout Summary Project

### Exercise for the position of FRONT-END Web Developer with React

## Goal: Build a "Purchase summary" user inteface using **React**. Time is limited 

Key features: 

- UI Elements: 
The "Pickup savings" tooltip
The "See Item details" expander 
The "Apply Promo code" expander 

- The user should be able to enter a promo code "DISCOUNT" and on applying it, see a 10% discount reflect in the pucharse summary. Use **Redux** for this. 

- Please refrain from using existing react components out there to help building this. For the pricing data, you can hard code it to and object/json and read from it.

- Build your UI and share the URL when ready 
Feel free yo use your own workflow too if easier and upload your poject files yo a GitHub repo along with the instruccions for loading and testing on my end.

- Reusability of component is a key factor to consider. You will be evaluated based on code correctness and quality
